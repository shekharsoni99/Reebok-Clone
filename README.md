# Reebok Website

<i> Although Reebok is famous for their shoes, during the 80s they started to introduce a wider range of products that included sports accessories and clothing. Over the years Reebok has developed high-quality clothing products such as track tops, and still maintain high-standard designs up to the present day.</i>
 
Hello everyone, Firstly I would like to thank all of you for showing interest in reading this Blog.
Also, I would thank the Masai team for providing us with this wonderful opportunity to clone a beautiful website of a well-reputed brand name that is Rebook.
We are given a project of cloning the shop4rebook.com website with a team of 5 members. I would like to introduce you to my team members.

We have used HTML, CSS & Javascript tools to complete our project.
Apart from that, we have used images and logos from different websites.
Also used Github to share our files and pages with each other and to make them accessible for others who want to see our codes.

We all have enjoyed this process of making this website and it’s a never-forget memory for all of us since it is our first project ever.
Every team member helped each other resulting in smooth process flow and never getting bored since we have no time to think anything apart from project completion.

What we have learned…
We have learned so many things.
1. How a complete website works.
2. How user login, logout & signup and how its data is verified in the backend.
3. How to make a layout of bigger pages by splitting it into smaller parts and how to change user experience with attractive layouts, designing, creativity.
4. How to write backend codes to do handle user data and how to use these data effectively.
5. How to store user data for future logins.
5. One important thing we have learned is how to work in a team.

<i> At last, I would thank all of my team members and Masai.
We hope to work together in the future and make many other exciting websites like this. </i>
